# Fine-Tuning LLMs with Prompts

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using various in-context learning methods, including:

- **Zero-shot learning**: The model is prompted to solve tasks with no prior examples.
- **Single-shot learning**: The model is given one example and then generalizes to new tasks.
- **Few-shot learning**: The model learns from a small number of examples.
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: The model is guided step-by-step to solve complex problems systematically.

The goal is to showcase how these methods improve the model's performance in tasks like generating structured outputs (e.g., JSON objects) or conducting sentiment analysis with reasoning steps.

## Features

- **Zero-shot, Single-shot, and Few-shot learning**: Demonstrates LLM's ability to generalize with minimal examples.
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Shows how breaking down tasks into logical steps can enhance output accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning**: Illustrates how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned to improve performance on specific tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Essential libraries (detailed in the `requirements.txt` file)

## Conclusion
This project explores how fine-tuning and different prompting techniques can enhance the performance of large language models in various tasks. By guiding the model through zero-shot, single-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought methods, we observe improvements in the model’s ability to generalize and produce structured outputs, especially in specialized tasks such as work item generation and sentiment analysis.
